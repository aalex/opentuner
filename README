Basic Tools for Compiling
-------------------------

To build applications in general, you should have the following packages installed on your system:

 automake,
 bison,
 build-essential,
 flex,
 libtool

These instructions are for Ubuntu GNU/Linux - and should work on Debian GNU/Linux as well. Toonloop should build on other platforms too. Please help us improving this documentation if you get it to work on other operating systems.


Dependencies
------------

Here is the list of Debian package that you will need to build it:

 gettext,
 help2man,
 libasound-dev,
 libboost-program-options-dev,
 libboost-filesystem-dev,
 libboost-system-dev,
 libclutter-1.0-dev,
 libglew1.5-dev,
 libglib2.0-dev,
 libglu1-mesa-dev,
 libstk0-dev,
 libxml2-dev,
 libxv-dev,
 mencoder

How to build it
---------------

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

There is also the handy ./one_click_build.sh that does it in a single script. (except the `sudo make install`)


How to run opentuner
--------------------

Note that you need to have the GLX acceleration set up in order to use Clutter, and therefore opentuner. 

Here is how to lauch it:
